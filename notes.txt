Simulation Ideas:
  Enter initial conditions, and then let the server do all the heavy lifting
  simulation will ouput some sort of data file that describes the various motions
    this way there all the calculations can be done on faster systems
  take this output file and 'play' it like a movie --> won't be interactive, but this is a trade-off for speed
    ability to rotate the view? scrub through the data, not just play staticly like a movie
    zoom, and move and whatnot
	
Implementation Ideas:
  Particle:
    basic particle data struct
    radius
    mass
    velocity vector
  Space:
    Keeps track of all the particles in the space
    dimensions of space
      maybe split up into multiple spaces: 1,2,3 etc
    time-tick func that makes all the particles act
      for every particle, need to calculate the forces of gravity between every other particle
      from this calculate the net effect of gravity
      only after all these vectors have been calculated, then move, don't move the particles before <---
  Gravity:
    given two particles, this spits out the force of gravity between them
  FileMaker:
    creates a file
      hangs around as somebody gives particle positions to it, and it formats and writes that particle

REAL NOTES:
  when a function fails, it will return -1, if success reutrn 0
